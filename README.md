# NodeRed Azure OpenAI module

## Configuration

Create the openai instance in Azure, then create a model, then with an API Key you're good to go.

## Supported models

currently only supports models with getChatCompletions
(so gpt-35-turbo-instruct isn't supported yet)

### Tested on

- gpt-35-turbo
- gpt-4

## TODO

- see if there's anything to do with Azure AI Search Service
- support more models
- perhaps add support to non-openai models in Azure AI services
